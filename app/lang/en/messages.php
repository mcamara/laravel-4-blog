While studying Computer Science and getting a Masters Degree in Information Technologies at the <a href="http://www.upc.edu" target="_blank">Universitat Polit&egrave;cnica de Catalunya</a> and an exchange time at the <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/" target="_blank">Northeastern University of Boston</a>, I started my professional career in some startups and freelance projects, all based in Barcelona.</p>

		<p>Entrepreneur as a way of life, I am always looking for new tech while thinking about how to use them in my current or future projects. I feel comfortable with open source code and I collaborate freely in code communities (for further references, please check my GitHub repository).</p>

		<p>Specialized in Web Development and algorithms, I have some other skills (learned both in class and real world) like Object Oriented Programming, Mentoring/Training, Database Design, Agile Development and troubleshooting among others. I am experienced at working on projects from initial idea and development phase, performing all design and architecture work and delivering the completed product on time and under budget. To sum up, I love to create something useful for the world!</p>

		<p>Currently I am more than willing to travel to almost anywhere in the world so, if you have a project you need help with and you think I could fit there, feel free to <a href="mailto:marc.camara.garcia@gmail.com" target="_top">contact me</a> and arrange a meeting. </p>',
